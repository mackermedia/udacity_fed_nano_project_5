### Project Instructions:

1. Review our course JavaScript Design Patterns.
2. Download the Knockout framework.
3. Write code required to add a full-screen map to your page using the Google Maps API.
4. Write code required to add map markers identifying a number of locations your are interested in within this neighborhood.
5. Implement the search bar functionality to search your map markers.
6. Implement a list view of the identified locations.
7. Add additional functionality using third-party APIs when a map marker, search result, or list view entry is clicked (ex. Yelp reviews, Wikipedia, StreetView/Flickr images, etc). If you need a refresher on making AJAX requests to third-party servers, check out our Intro to AJAX course.

### Running the application:

Open `index.html` in your browser, by right-clicking. Or enter in the url bar:

`file:///PATH/TO/YOUR/DIRECTORY/index.html`

### Notes:

I ended up having to write my own proxy for the Brewery DB API as it doesn't return CORS headers for requests via JavaScript.
